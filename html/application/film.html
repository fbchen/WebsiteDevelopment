<h1>Virtual Reality in Film</h1>
<p>Virtual reality is a very common theme in science fiction movies, where it is often used a way to turn the fantastical into something that seems totally real.</p>
<p>TRON, for instance, was one of the first movies to use virtual reality as a plot element. The main characters were taken from reality and transported into a virtual world inside a computer. This is not 100% like the virtual reality we know today but the concept of another reality inside of a computer reminds the same.
</p>
<p>Some of the most popular movies of our time use concepts of virtual reality. Some of these movies, which you&apos;ve probably heard of, include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>TRON &amp; TRON Legacy</li>
	<li>The Matrix series</li>
	<li>Vanilla Sky</li>
</ul>
<p>The list continues indefinitely. We can certainly expect such a list to continue growing in the future as the ideas behind virtual reality are fully explored in film.</p>
<h2>Second Life&apos;s Film Festival</h2>
<p>Second Life, at one time, partnered with the 48 Hour Film Project to produce the first film festival to take place in a virtual world.</p>
<p>The participants of the festival had to create a film set totally within the world of Second Life. In true 48HFP style, they were given a genre, a character, a proper and a piece of dialogue, which must be incorporated into their films, and went away to write and edit a Second Life film within 48 hours.</p>
<p>The winners of the &lsquo;virtual film festival&rsquo; were given the opportunity to have their films shown at the real&minus;life 48 Hour Film Project event.</p>
