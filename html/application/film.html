            <p class="content">Virtual reality is a very common theme in <b>Science Fiction</b> movies, where it is often used a way to turn the fantastical into something that seems totally real.</p>
			<p class="content">TRON, for instance, was one of the first movies to use virtual reality as a plot element. The main characters were taken from reality and transported into a virtual world inside a computer. This is not 100% like the virtual reality we know today but the concept of another reality inside of a computer reminds the same.</p>
			<p class="content">The list continues indefinitely. We can certainly expect such a list to continue growing in the future as the ideas behind virtual reality are fully explored in film.</p>
