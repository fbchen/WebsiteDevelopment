	How does VR work? How does wearable tech make you think you're standing on Mars when you're actually about to bump into the kitchen counter? We'll be explaining how virtual reality headsets work here.
	</p>
	Let's start with some basics.
	</p>
	<p>
	The headset set-up is being used by Oculus, Sony, HTC, Samsung and Google and usually requires three things. A PC, console or smartphone to run the app or game, a headset which secures a display in front of your eyes (which could be the phone's display) and some kind of input - head tracking, controllers, hand tracking, voice, on-device buttons or trackpads.
	</p>
	<p>
	Total immersion is what everyone making a VR headset, game or app is aiming towards - making the virtual reality experience so real that we forget the computer, headgear and accessories and act exactly as we would in the real world. So how do we get there?
